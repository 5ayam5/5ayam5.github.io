	abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) is necessary to run large scale quantum programs. Regardless of error correcting code, hardware platform, or systems architecture, QEC systems are limited by the types of gates which they can perform efficiently. In order to make the base code's gate set universal, they typically rely on the production of a single type of resource state, commonly T, in a different code which is then distilled and injected into the base code. This process is neither space nor time efficient and can account for a large portion of the total execution time and physical qubit cost of any program. In order to circumvent this problem, alternatives have been proposed, such as the production of continuous angle rotation states {\textbackslash}cite\{akahoshi2023partially, choi2023fault\}. These proposals are powerful because they not only enable localized resource generation but also can potentially reduce total space requirements. However, the production of these states is non-deterministic and can require many repetitions in order to obtain the desired resource. The original proposals suggest architectures which do not actively account for realtime management of its resources to minimize total execution time. Without this, static compilation of programs to these systems will be unnecessarily expensive. In this work, we propose a realtime compilation of programs to these continuous angle systems and a generalized resource sharing architecture which actively minimizes total execution time based on expected production rates. To do so, we repeatedly redistribute resources on-demand which depending on the underlying hardware can cause excessive classical control overhead. We further address this by dynamically selecting the frequency of recompilation. Our compiler and architecture improves over the baseline proposals by an average of \$2{\textbackslash}times\$.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers show promise to solve select problems otherwise intractable on classical computers. How-ever, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era devices are currently prone to various sources of error. Quantum error correction (QEC) shows promise as a path towards fault tolerant quantum computing. Surface codes, in particular, have become ubiquitous throughout literature for their efficacy as a quantum error correcting code, and can execute quantum circuits via lattice surgery operations. Lattice surgery also allows for logical qubits to maneuver around the architecture, if there is space for it. Hardware used for near-term demonstrations have both spatially and temporally varying error results in logical qubits. By maneuvering logical qubits around the topology, an average logical error rate (LER) can be enforced. We propose cyclic qubit mappings (CQM), a dynamic remapping technique implemented during compilation to mitigate hardware heterogeneity by expanding and contracting logical qubits. In addition to LER averaging, CQM shows initial promise given it's minimal execution time overhead and effective resource utilization.},

	abstract = {3-D DRAM provides a significant performance boost resulting from substantial memory bandwidth. However, the stacked memory architecture exhibits high power density, causing thermal hotspots. Further, systems under power constraints require careful planning for intelligent allocation of the available power to their various components. A straightforward dynamic power management policy of allocating more power to potentially high memory activity 3-D DRAM ranks so as to maximize system performance causes a rise in the temperature of such ranks, making them susceptible to thermal stalls and shutdown by dynamic thermal management (DTM) strategies. A rise in rank temperature, in turn, increases the leakage power of memory ranks, affecting power budgeting decisions. Thus, a coordinated strategy for power budgeting and thermal management is needed. We propose an adjacency-aware dynamic power budgeting technique, 3D-TemPo, which dynamically performs a reward-based power allocation to memory ranks, in order to maximize 3-D DRAM performance under power and thermal constraints, and is sensitive to strong thermal correlations between vertically adjacent ranks. We evaluate 3D-TemPo using SPEC CPU2017 and PARSEC 2.1 benchmark suites and observe speedups of 1{\textbackslash}times to 17.94{\textbackslash}times compared to baseline strategies.},
