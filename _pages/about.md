I am a PhD student in the [ECE Department](https://ece.utexas.edu) at The University of Texas at Austin, advised by [Dr. Jonathan Baker](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/jonathan-baker).

I am interested in architectural design for realising Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers (FTQC), with a specific focus on scheduling realtime operations, and minimizing program runtime. Apart from this, I am also interested in both logical and physical compilation of quantum algorithms to surface code and qLDPC architectures.

Before this, I obtained my B. Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in), where I was working with [Dr. Preeti Ranjan Panda](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~panda/) on 3D DRAM.
